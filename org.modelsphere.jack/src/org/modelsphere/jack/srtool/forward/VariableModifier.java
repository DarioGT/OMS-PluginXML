/**
 * <H1>EXECUTION VARIABLES</H1><BR>
 * Execution variables are strings that are assigned at execution time. User can create how many
 * execution variables she wants, but each of them must have a different name.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * Rule variables of any class can assign values variables; the execution variable X is assigned by
 * specified the modifier VariableModifier(X, rule), where X is the name of the variable, and rule
 * is the rule that is immediately processed to generate the string to store. For example,
 * VariableModifier('action', new Template('INSERT')) assigns the string 'INSERT' to the execution
 * variable 'action'. The second parameter of the VariableModifier() constructor is a Rule; this
 * Rule is processed immediately at the level of the template is assigned to the execution variable
 * that defines it, and the result string of the processed rule is assigned to the execution
 * variable. In other words, execution variables contains strings, not rules.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * A value assigned to an execution variable is accessible only to Rule variable that assigned it
 * and its descendant.
